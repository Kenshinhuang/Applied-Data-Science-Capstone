    "Initial analysis on the data shows that Chinatown or Little Tokyo might be good candidate locations. However, those two neighborhoods are already saturated with Asian restaurants. It is unlikely that people in those two neighborhoods have appetite for a high-end restaurant where the menu prices might be higher than at the restaurant around the corner of the street. \n",

The data showed that while both districts are equally populated with restaurants, the Entertainment District is more saturated with Asian restaurants than the Financial District. Saturation often implies fierce competition.\n",

    "Furthermore, the average income in the Financial District is much higher than the average income in the Entertainment District. It seems that people in the Financial District is more likely (and may be more frequently as well) to dine at a high-end restaurant, due to their financial freedom. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some cultural and lifestyle aspects that must be taken into account when considering whether to open the high-end restaurant in Financial District or Entertainment District. It is true that the Financial District is not as saturated with Asian restaurants as the Entertainment District; it is also an economic powerhouse, full of customers capable to frequently dine at a high-end restaurant. However, that is during the working hours. As night falls, people leave the Financial District and pour into the Entertainment District for the shows and parties. In the evenings and during the weekends, the walkways in the Financial District are almost deserted. These cultural and lifestyle aspects make the Financial District less than ideal. The evenings, especially 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM are considered to be the Golden Hours for restaurant businesses. The Golden Hours are exactly when people leave the Financial District and flock into the Entertainment District. Furthermore, past surveys showed that the higher a customer's income, the less likely the customer will spend money on afternoon meal, a meal the customer has during his working hours in the Financial District. \n"

    "All things considered, I do not recommend opening the high-end asian restaurant in the Financial District. A well-rounded business decision should take all factors into consideration, especially the factors that have a direct impact on the business. I recommend opening it on side of the Entertainment District that is near the Financial District. More specifically, I recommend situating the new high-end Asian restaurant on or near the University Avenue. This is where the Entertainment District and Financial District connect with a lot of landmarks in the vicinity, Hotel Fairmont Royal York, InterContinetal Toronto Centre, Ritz Carlton Toronto, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Shangri-La Hotel Toronto, just to name a few. This is very business area with high foot and vehicle traffic, which translates into high visibility for the new high-end Asian restaurant. "
